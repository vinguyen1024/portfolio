        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My love for web development started back in the late '90s when a friend showed me her GeoCities page. I was fascinated by the cute colors and fun JS effects, so I decided to create my own page by learning through one of the best methods at the time:  copying and pasting source code. All through middle school and into my 20s, I continued the hobby by customizing sites like Xanga, LiveJournal, MySpace, and WordPress.</p>
        <p>I eventually landed a data entry job, but my interest in web development quickly shifted my role. My manager, who became my mentor, taught me the ropes of semantic HTML, SEO, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, some PHP and even creating graphics on Photoshop. That experience really fueled my passion for creating smooth, user-friendly sites. I joined my mentor when he started his own company a few years later. There, I expanded my front and back-end knowledge with React.js, PHP, Python, Next.js, and Sass. Working there really shaped me into the developer I am today.</p>
        <p>When I'm not on the computer coding, I like to spend my time with creative hobbies like crafting, being a bedroom DJ, something music related like piano or singing, and cooking. I also love going to music festivals, playing video games like Final Fantasy or Kingdom Hearts, and hanging out with my dog.</p>
